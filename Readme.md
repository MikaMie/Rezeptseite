# 🥘 Recipe App – Fullstack MERN Application with Docker & VPS Deployment

This is a **fullstack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** application for managing cooking recipes. It was the first project where I fully combined **frontend and backend** development, containerized the app with **Docker**, and deployed it to a **self-hosted VPS** using a custom domain.

With this project, I brought together all major areas of modern web development: **React for the frontend**, **Express/MongoDB for the backend**, and a **production-grade DevOps setup** using Docker, Nginx, and environment configuration.
